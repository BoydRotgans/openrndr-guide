# Gradle based projects

In this guide it is assumed the reader works on projects that are build using Gradle. Gradle may seem a bit overwhelming at first so here are some instructions to get things going.

## Creating a new OPENRNDR project

By far the easiest way is to clone the template project
```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-gradle-template.git
```

This contains everything needed to start, notably the `build.gradle` with the right dependencies and the Gradle wrappers.

## Importing Gradle projects in IntelliJ

New project from existing sources.
