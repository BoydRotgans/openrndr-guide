# File drops

OPENRNDR programs can listen to file drop events. File drop events are generated by a user dragging and releasing one or more file icons onto the program window.

```kotlin
fun setup() {
    window.drop.listen {
        println("${it.files.size} files dropped at ${it.position}")
    }
}
```
