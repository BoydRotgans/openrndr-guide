# RNDR #
RNDR is a framework for creative coding for Java 8+. 

RNDR is designed and developed for prototyping as well as the development of robust performant visual and interactive applications. 

RNDR provides:
 * a light weight application framework to quickly get you started 
 * a fast OpenGL 3.3 backed drawer written using the JOGL OpenGL bindings
 * a set of minimal and clean APIs that welcome programming in a modern style
 * an extensive shape drawing and manipulation API
 * asynchronous image loading
