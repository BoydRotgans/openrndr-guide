# OPENRNDR #
OPENRNDR is a framework for creative coding for Kotlin / Java 8+ that simplifies writing real-time interactive software. It fully embraces its existing infrastructure of (open source) libraries, editors, debuggers and build tools.

OPENRNDR is designed and developed for prototyping as well as the development of robust performant visual and interactive applications. It is not an application, it is a collection of software components that aid the creation of applications.

OPENRNDR provides:
 * a light weight application framework to quickly get you started 
 * a fast OpenGL 3.3 backed drawer written using the LWJGL OpenGL bindings
 * a set of minimal and clean APIs that welcome programming in a modern style
 * an extensive shape drawing and manipulation API
 * asynchronous image loading

The OPENRNDR [Roadmap](Roadmap) can be found here.
