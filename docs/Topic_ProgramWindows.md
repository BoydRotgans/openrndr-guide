# Program windows

An OPENRNDR program can listen to events generated by its window.

## Window properties

### Window title

The window title can be set and read using the `title` property.

```kotlin
window.title = "Lo and behold!"
```

### Window position

The window position can be read and set using the `position` property.

```kotlin
window.position = Vector2(30.0, 30.0)
```

## Window events

### Window move event

This event is generated when the window was moved.

```kotlin
fun setup() {
    window.moved.listen {
        println("the window was moved")
    }
}
```

### Window size event

This event is generated when the window was sized.

```kotlin
fun setup() {
    window.sized.listen {
        println("the window was sized")
    }
}
```

### Window focus event

This event is generated when the program window gains focus.

```kotlin
fun setup() {
    window.focus.listen {
        println("the window has gained focus")
    }
}
```

### Window unfocus event

This event is generated when the program window loses focus.

```kotlin
fun setup() {
    window.focus.listen {
        println("the window has lost its focus")
    }
}
```
